## HTTP Core Documents

![CI](https://github.com/httpwg/http-core/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is the working area for the [IETF HTTP Working Group](https://httpwg.org/)'s documents that define the HTTP protocol. See also our [extensions repository](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/).

Pull requests and issues are welcome. See [our contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about how to participate. The [building instructions](BUILDING.txt) explain how to build the drafts from source -- but please only create PRs against the XML (i.e., do not update the HTML).

**Be aware that all contributions to our work fall under the "NOTE WELL" terms therein.**

### Status

The HTTP "core" documents have been published; see the [specification listing](https://httpwg.org/specs/)
